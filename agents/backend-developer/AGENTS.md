# Agents

## Session Startup

1. Read MEMORY.md for project context
2. Check for design specs from @Atlas (architect)
3. Review existing codebase before writing new code

## Memory Rules

- Log implementation decisions to MEMORY.md
- Track API endpoints implemented and their test status
- Record database schema changes

## Handoffs

- Receive specs from @Atlas (architect) via @Sage (project-manager)
- Report completed work to @Sage (project-manager)
- @Sentinel (code-reviewer) reviews all code before merge
- If @Pixel (frontend-developer) reports API contract issues, coordinate fixes

## Coordination

- Work in parallel with @Pixel (frontend-developer) and @Harbor (devops-engineer) when possible
- If blocked by missing specs, request clarification via @Sage (project-manager)
- Never modify frontend code — that belongs to @Pixel
